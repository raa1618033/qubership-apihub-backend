# Build(task) model
Apihub implement pull model for build processing.
I.e. BE have a queue of builds and have an interface to take the build.
In this schema BE is not aware of builders
It allows to scale builders(browser, node services) horizontally without changes in BE configuration. 

# build config
Biold config is a metadata set for an object that will be created during the build.

Example:
```
{
    "files": [
        {
            "slug": "",
            "index": 0,
            "fileId": "swagger.json",
            "labels": [
            ],
            "publish": true
        }
    ],
    "status": "draft",
    "version": "2024.3",
    "metadata": {
    },
    "buildType": "build",
    "createdBy": "username",
    "packageId": "username.g1.p1",
    "publishId": "",
    "publishedAt": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "previousVersion": "2024.1",
    "previousVersionPackageId": ""
}
```

"publish" for file defines is the file should present in result(builder output) 

"publishId" is generated by Apihub BE when the build is accepted and stored to DB

"buildType" defines the logic of build process
options:
* "build" - regular version publish
* "changelog" - changelog only
* "documentGroup" - export
* "reducedSourceSpecifications" - export
* "mergedSpecification" - export


# Stages for buildType = build (in builder lib)
0) detect file type (swagger 2.0, openapi 3.0+, graphql, protobuf) 
0.1) convert swagger 2.0 to openapi 3.0
1) bundling (resolve ext refs)
2) make operations from specs and make search scopes (set of words in a file excluding specification terms(e.x. description, summery, parameters, etc))
3) make comparison if previous version is defined

# result

![build result example](build_result_example.png)

* "info.json" - main file which contains build(future version) parameters and metadata.
* documents.json - list of documents with metadata
* operations.json - list of operatrions with metadata
* comparisons.json - list of comparisons with metadata
* notifications.json - warnings from builder

# build sequences
## Success cases
### build type = build & client_build=false:
publish request -> validation -> save build entity and sources(tables build and build_src ) -> build is in queue (status==none) -> 
build is taken by node service *and bound to builder id* (status=running) -> the build is processed on node service (node service sends keepalives(set build status=running) while the build is running) -> node service sends build status = success with build result data -> builder id is validated -> build result is stored in DB (table build_result) or in minio -> build result is validated -> build result is stored in DB via single transaction -> search indexes calculated asynchronously(somehow)

### build type = build & client_build=true:
publish request (with client_build=true and builderId!=null) -> validation -> save build entity and sources(tables build and build_src ) -> the build is bound to the builderId from request and status = running -> buildId is returned to the client -> the build is processed on client (client sends keepalives(set build status=running) while the build is running)-> client sends build status = success with build result data -> builder id is validated -> build result is stored in DB (table build_result) or in minio -> build result is validated -> build result is stored in DB via single transaction -> search indexes calculated asynchronously(somehow)

### build type = changelog
almost the same, but only comparisons generated and stored

### build type = documentGroup \ reducedSourceSpecifications \ mergedSpecification
TODO


## Error cases:
### builder is restarted (state is lost)
For example due to OOM killed or browser(tab) is closed.

start -> processing -> keepalives stop going -> BE detects that the build is no longer processed by the following criterea: "now - last_active > {timeout}" ->
the build is considered as free and goes to the queue again -> when node service is ready to take the build, restart_count is checked. If restart_count >= 2 then the build is failed with message "Restart count exceeded limit" -> if restart is available, build is taken by node service *and bound to builder id* (status=running) **and restart_count is incremented** -> build as usual

### builder internal error (handled)
Internal error(exception) happens in builder logic and it's caught during the processing.

Builder sets status=error and error details.
New version/changelog/export is not created.
Error build is not restarted.

### problem with source documents
The error in source documents is detected by builder.
Builder sets status=error and details regarding the problem.
New version/changelog/export is not created.
Error build is not restarted.

# build statuses
none - build is not strarted
running - build is started
complete - successfully completed
error - completed with error

# DB
Related tables:
* build - list of build
* build_src - config and sources archive(zip)
* build_result or minio (depends on configuration) - result archive(zip)
